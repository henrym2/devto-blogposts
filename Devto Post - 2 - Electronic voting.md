_TLDR; PC or Paper?_

As a student I'm constantly exposed to the political microcosm that is the students union and beyond. Seeing this and the comparisons between the wider world I often wonder as a developing (_badum bum ching_) developer what either impact we can have and what impact we should have on the politics around us.

Now that E-voting is being introduced, and poorly so in many cases, I have to ask, and especially to more experiences members of the community. Do you think its a good idea? Do you have any faith in it's implementation? Or is it all just a stack of cards waiting to fall down.
